# Post Processing Plugin
#### An add-on for Godot 4.2, available in the Godot Asset Library.
After moving from Unity to Godot in late 2019, I've felt like there was a lack of post-processing tooling. In February 2024 I decided to make and publish this simple add-on.

## Features:
- Custom CanvasLayer node, "PostProcess".
- 2D/3D support.
- Custom resource type to save preset configurations, "PostProcessPreset".
- Ability to dynamically modify effects through code.

## Effects:
- ASCII (Monochromatic / Render everything as ASCII text) (for now uses only: `.:-+*=%@#`).
- Chromatic Aberration
- Blur
- Vignette
- Glitch (Animated)
- Outline (Not the best implementation, still being worked on).
- Screen Shake
- Analog Monitor
- Grain (Animated)
- Circular Waves / Speed Lines (Low Quality, still being worked on).
- Fish eye effect.
- CRT/VHS

## Planned Features:
- [x] Effect Presets
- [ ] More Effects like: `Color Grading`, `Dithering`, `Motion Blur`, etc.
- [x] Smooth transitions between previous and future effect states (ex: 0 blur slowly rising to 100) see Section: Changing Effects Through Code.


## Basic Use:
Simply add the custom PostProcess node to the scene tree directly or through code. Set the "Configuration" property of the PostProcess to a PostProcessPreset (either pre-made or instantiated on-the-spot) and run the game. The add-on uses some simple "Screen Space" shaders to apply the desired effects.

### Adding changes only through code:


All values can be modified during runtime and the changes will be applied immediately. This applies to on/off states as well as numbered parameters. All effects can be applied in parallel and work together well.

(NOTE: Effects are applied on rendering layers: 99-120, so i suggest putting UI above 120 and anything else like player, world etc. under 99!)



## Changing Effects Through Code.
In this example, we enable/disable ScreenShake!
```gdscript
extends Node3D

func _process(_delta) -> void:
    # Check if Screen Shake is enabled
    if $PostProcess.configuration.ScreenShake:
        # Change the Screen Shake Power by 0.1 each frame
        $PostProcess.configuration.ScreenShakePower += 0.1
    
        # if Screen Shake Power is bigger than 2, change it back to 0!
        if $PostProcess.configuration.ScreenShakePower >= 2:
            $PostProcess.configuration.ScreenShakePower = 0

    # if key T is pressed, Toggle Screen Shake
    if Input.is_key_pressed(KEY_T):
        if $PostProcess.configuration.ScreenShake:
            $PostProcess.configuration.ScreenShake = false
        else:
            $PostProcess.configuration.ScreenShake = true

```

This also works with other effects like:
`ASCII`, `Blur`, `ChromaticAberration`, `FishEye`, etc...
